# Pavilion-Topology
Routes from Mesh Topology to Pavilion Designs via Rhino, GH and Kangaroo

The final assignment for 'Software 1' for MRAC 2021-22 was to develop and present an exploration for the design of an “art installation/pavilion” developed from mesh topology modeling.

The size was limited from a minimun of 3m x 3m x 3m to a maximum  to of 6m x 6m x 6m. In principle the concepts were also to be developed bearing in mind their possible fabrication with metal sheets, unless permission was given to explore different material.*.

The design process should:

Explore a series of basic geometries -  possible shapes / configurations - then evaluate them and choose one based on selection criteria.
For the chosen basic geometry, explore different mesh topology configurations and evaluate their properties. The metrics used (e.g. curvature; direction of stripes; material used ; complexity of fabrication/assembly) should be explained.
Explore possible modifications to the mesh topology (e.g. changing the faces’ direction using the shift list of mesh face points, which can leads to very different consequences in terms of fabrication).
Explore the consequences of smoothing and/or dynamic relaxation.
Choose a stripes method: stripper (for contiguous stripes) or 'warp & weft'.
As regards a possible fabrication process, make initial considerations such as e.g. calculate the quantity of stripes, their shape and nesting, labeling strategy, material use, leftover material, and propose a possible connection system.

Deliverables (organized in corresponding subfolders)
- presentation (Google Slides format) - use the template we will give you in the SUBMISSIONS/finals folder in Google Drive.
- images: (png format - use jpg only if a png is impossible to produce, in any case, use maximum quality jpg and limit jpg images to the fewer possible)
- codes and models: Rhino + GH + any other necessary file for the final output.
- <optional> videos (.mov or .mp4 format) - all videos produced, whether included in the presentation or not.

Note: 
The 'SOFTer SKIN' group was allowed to develop a study for a pavilion of stretched fabric in a cubic volume.
The 'Project LoopS' group was allowed to develop a study for an art installation/pavilion of the stretched fabric 'Barrisol'.
The 'Innies and Outies' group was allowed to develop a study for a pavilion made of stitched veneer.
